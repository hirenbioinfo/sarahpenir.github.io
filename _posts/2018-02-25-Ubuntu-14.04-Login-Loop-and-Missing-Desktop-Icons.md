After restarting my desktop the other day, I found Ubuntu 14.04 stuck in a login loop. It was not the first time this problem had reared its ugly head, and luckily, I was able to easily amend its first instance with the following steps:

1. Login to ```tty1``` by pressing ```Ctrl``` + ```Alt``` + ```F1```
2. Reinstall Ubuntu desktop (i.e. Unity): ```sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop```
3. Voila, reboot: ```sudo reboot```

Unfortunately, the second and most recent occurrence of the login loop was much peskier as the following attempts proved to be insufficient for solving the problem:

1. Reset Unity: ```sudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool``` followed by ```unity-tweak-tool --reset-unity```
2. Changing the ownership of ```.Xauthority``` and ```.ICEauthority```: ```chown username:username .Xauthority``` and ```chown username:username .ICEauthority```
3. Install a new desktop (i.e. Gnome): ```sudo apt-get install gnome-shell ubuntu-gnome-desktop```
4. Install a new login manager: ```sudo apt-get install gdm``` followed by ```sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm```
5. Upgrade the packages installed on the system: ```sudo apt-get update``` followed by ```sudo apt-get dist-upgrade```

None of these fixes worked for me. I almost resigned to being dejected over the weekend until I randomly decided to undo some of the changes I made in my ```.profile``` earlier that day (I set a new environment variable using ```export PATH```). In short, ```.profile``` is another place to look at if all else fails.

After being able to finally login, another problem in the form of missing desktop icons presented itself. And at a fortuitous moment, that one time I've played around with ```gnome-tweak-tool``` (```sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool```) came to mind:

Just toggle ```Icons on Desktop``` from ```OFF``` to ```ON```, and that should solve the problem.
