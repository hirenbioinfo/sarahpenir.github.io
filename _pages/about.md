I am currently a research assistant of the PCARI-funded Shared Genomics Core Laboratory under the Philippine Genome Center (PGC), and an MSc student in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology at the University of Philippines Diliman. I specialize in the entire spectrum of next-generation sequencing (NGS) research, from library preparation and sequencing to data analysis. I have an experience in working with Unix/Linux environment, and scripting with Python, Perl, and R.

This is a self-serving space that compiles some of the things I've learned over time, mostly about coding, bioinformatics, and statistics.
