I am currently a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry (MPI-BPC) under the International Max Planck Research School for Genome Science (IMPRS-GS). I obtained a master's degree in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology from the University of the Philippines Diliman. I specialize in the entire spectrum of next-generation sequencing (NGS) research, from library preparation and sequencing to data analysis. I have an experience in working with Unix/Linux environment, and scripting with Python, Perl, and R.

This is a self-serving space that compiles some of the things I've learned over time, mostly about coding, bioinformatics, and statistics.
